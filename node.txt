#To set the PATH environment variable in PowerShell, you can use the $env automatic variable as follows:

$env:PATH += ";C:\node-v18.15.0-win-x64"

#This will append the path C:\node-v18.15.0-win-x64 to the current PATH environment variable.

#To remove this path from the PATH environment variable, you can use the following command:

$env:PATH = $env:PATH -replace ";C:\\node-v18.15.0-win-x64", ""

#This will remove the C:\node-v18.15.0-win-x64 path from the PATH environment variable.
